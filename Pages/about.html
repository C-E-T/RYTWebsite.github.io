	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>Revolution Youth Theatre is a not for profit charity offering youth in Windsor the opportunity to experience the thrill of being part of a theatre company at no cost to them. Our emphasis will be about the process and not just the final show.</p>
	
	<p>we offer the children the whole theatre experience. Not only will youth be able to learn the ropes of performing but will be encouraged to learn the backstage aspects of theatre as well by being hands on in all aspects of the show including, set, prop and costume design, back stage crew, sound and lights, and onstage performers. RYT guides them from conception straight through to closing night.</p>

	<p>Our board of directors are an open minded group of parent volunteers who value the input of both actors and parents and look forward to the sharing of thoughts and ideas to make this the best experience for everyone
